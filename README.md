![Uploading show_game.gifâ€¦]()

## installing
before running ```main.py``` run :
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
or install pillow and pygame-ce by yourself :
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
its always recommended to use virtual enviroment

## playing
if you are on windows :
```
py main.py
```
otherwise for linux distros :
```
python3 main.py
```
nice play !

## future plans
There is no intenions to add any new system like particles or cutscenes<br>
Although if I developed them on future projects I might try itegrating them with this project.<br>
there is an intention on creating a ```blks.exe``` to easen the process of installing and playing if you are not conecernd with the code , though it still needs a little bit of polishing . <br>
so stay tuned !
